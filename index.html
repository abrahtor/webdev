<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--In HTML, the doctype is the required "<!DOCTYPE html>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a browser from switching into so-called 
  "quirks mode" when rendering a document; that is, the "<!DOCTYPE html>" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, 
  rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.-->

<html lang="en-us">
  <!--
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.
    The lang global attribute helps define the language of an element: the language that non-editable elements are written in
    <html lang="en-us"> specifies that the page is written in US English.

      The <body> HTML element represents the content of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document.
      
      The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled
      in some way using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element).

      The <img> HTML element embeds an image into the document. The HTMLImageElement property src, which reflects the HTML src attribute, specifies 
      the image to display in the <img> element. The HTMLImageElement property alt provides fallback (alternate) text to display when the image specified 
      by the <img> element is not loaded.

      The <h1> to <h6> HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.

      The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to 
      group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used 
      only when no other semantic element is appropriate. <span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level element whereas a <span> 
      is an inline element.

          <p>
            This is Cookie "Cooks" Montoya and she is nearly 3 years old. She is a mix of Siberian Husky,
            Alaskan Malamute, German Shepherd & Labrador Retriever. She is a Craig's List rescue and it has been
            an absolute joy to be her owner. She enjoys trips to the dog park, time with her boyfriend Zeus,
            time with her humans, and pupcups from the local coffee shops! Did I mention that she really
            loves treats?

          <p>
            Zeus is country dog living in the big city, he was 3 months old when he was adopted off the farm. He is now
            nearly 3 years old. He is mix of Siberian Husky, Alaskan Malamute, and Canadian Eskimo.
            He is so smart, a little too smart, as he is quite the escape artist. Like Cookie, he enjoys spending time at the dog park, spending time with his humans on his terms, and trips to the local coffee shops. Unlike Cookie, Zeus is quite the talker, always making his opinions known to others.
